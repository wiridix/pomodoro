# Pomodoro

# Introduction

This application is developed with React, Typescript and Material Ui.

The Pomodoro Technique is a method to improve the management of time spent on an activity.

Pomodoro is the practice of choosing a single task and making the small effort of spending 25 minutes fully focused on that initiative, followed by short breaks. It is recommended to work on a specific task for 25 minutes, take a break of 5m and repeat the 25 minute pomodoro four times and then take a break of 20 or more minutes.
